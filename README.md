# Image classification using CIFAR-10 dataset
This project is a semester mini project of COMP 484 (Machine Learning) done by the students of Kathmandu University. We have used CIFAR 10 dataset which consist of 60000 images labelled over 10 classes namely aeroplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck. In this project Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to improve the accuracy of image classification. The CNN is built using the Keras and Tensorflow as backend. The project is done in Google Colab and the file is in the .ipnyb format. The final accuracy obtained is of 76.49%.

The dataset was donwloaded from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

The libraries used in this project are tensorflow, keras, matplotlib, numpy and scipy.
The project was completed by following the procedures which include understanding the dataset, preprocessing the images, constructing the CNN model, train the CNN and predicting.
